# Summarize _YT Videos_ using _Chat With RTX_
Leverage Chat with RTX to summarize videos in your backlog. 

(1) Get text transcripts for videos then (2) feed it to Chat With RTX (3) save hours of time instead of having to watch full videos.

## Requirements:
* Hardware & Operating System that can run Chat With RTX
  * (or remote access to a machine that does) 
* Python (3+)
* _YouTube Transcript/Subtitle API (including automatically generated subtitles and subtitle translations)_
  * https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/
* Web browser with access to a Console or Developer Tools (press F12)

## How-to:

1. Get video URLs from a playlist
 * Use the code in [ExportVideoTitleAndUrls.js](START_HERE/ExportVideoTitleAndUrls.js)
 * Save the output to a .csv file
2. Convert raw `.csv` to structured `.json.`
3. [Optional] Filter any unwanted files
4. Open `Transcripts` folder in Chat With RTX
5. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰

## TODO
* Investigate if it's possible to fetch more relevant information about the videos, in Step #1
 * For example any tags, or video descriptions. Any relevant info that is not just pure metadata
